WebSockets is a technology that allows a **two-way communication channel** to be opened between a client (like a web browser) and a server. 

### Key Points:
1. **Persistent Connection**:
   - Unlike regular HTTP, where the client sends a request and waits for a response, WebSockets keep the connection open.
   - This allows the client and server to continuously send data to each other without starting a new connection every time.

2. **Real-Time Communication**:
   - WebSockets are great for apps that need real-time updates, like:
     - Chat applications.
     - Live notifications.
     - Multiplayer games.
     - Stock price updates.

3. **How It Works**:
   - The client (browser) sends a request to the server to establish a WebSocket connection.
   - Once connected, both the client and server can send and receive messages at any time.
   - Messages are exchanged quickly and efficiently because the connection stays open.

4. **Example Analogy**:
   - Think of a WebSocket as a phone call: once you dial and connect, you can talk (send messages) back and forth without having to hang up and redial for every message.

### Why Use WebSockets?
- **Speed**: No need to repeatedly connect and disconnect, making communication faster.
- **Efficiency**: Uses less bandwidth because you avoid sending extra headers (like in HTTP requests).
- **Flexibility**: Both the client and server can send messages at any time, enabling real-time updates.

In summary, WebSockets make it easy to build interactive and real-time applications by enabling a continuous conversation between the client and the server.

### Multi-Client Chat

One of the most powerful features of WebSockets is that multiple clients can connect to the same server at the same time and exchange messages, enabling real-time communication between them.

For example, in a chat app:

Clients Connect to the Same Server:

Each user (client) establishes a WebSocket connection to the chat server.
The server manages all these connections simultaneously.
Message Broadcasting:

When one client sends a message, the server receives it.
The server then broadcasts (forwards) the message to all other connected clients.
How It Works in a Chat App:
Hereâ€™s a simplified flow:

Client A, Client B, and Client C connect to the chat server.
Client A sends a message, "Hello, everyone!"
The server receives this message and sends it to both Client B and Client C.
All clients see the message in real-time.


By default, WebSocket servers do not automatically send the message back to the sender; they broadcast the message only to other connected clients. To resolve this, the server needs to explicitly send the message to all clients, including the sender.
